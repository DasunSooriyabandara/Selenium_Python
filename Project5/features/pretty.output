  Scenario: User searches for eLearning.lk on Google and navigates to the Python course  # elearning.feature:3
    Given we go to Google and search for eLearning.lk                                    # steps/elearning.py:12
    When we click the eLearning.lk link from Google                                      # steps/elearning.py:23
    Then we should be on the eLearning.lk website                                        # steps/elearning.py:29
    When the user searches for the Python course in the eLearning.lk search bar          # steps/elearning.py:34
    And the user clicks on the Python course                                             # steps/elearning.py:43
    Then the user should be on the Python course page                                    # steps/elearning.py:48
    When the user checks the course content                                              # steps/elearning.py:52
